#Responsive Alignment for Bootstrap 3

Bootstrap 3 is pretty amazing, but it falls short when it comes to offering responsive classes for element floats and text alignment. I've created a set of Bootstrap 3 compatible classes that fill this omission. If you are at all familiar with Bootstrap, these should be pretty straight forward for you

```html
<p class="text-left-xs text-center-sm text-right-md text-left-lg">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</p>

<div class=pull-left-xs pull-right-sm">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</div>
```

### What's Included?
- I've provided the LESS files that you can compile directly into your Bootstrap files, as well as compiled and minified CSS.
